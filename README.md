# CINE ORGANISATOR ðŸŽ¥
       
This project is a command-line application that allows users to manage a collection of series and movies they want to watch, as well as those they have already seen. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for adding, removing, and organising series and films, while also offering information about their viewing status. 

## Functionalities

- **Add Series and Films**: Add new series and films to your "To Watch" or "Watched" list.
- **Remove Series and Films**: Remove items from your collection based on their status.
- **Update Watched Seasons**: Track the number of seasons you've watched for each series.
- **Automated Search**: Uses web scraping functionality and fuzzy search to find information on series and films.
- **Stay Up to Date**: Refresh your collection to get updates on new seasons or releases for series you watched.
- **Offline Access and Search**: Users can access their added movies and series offline and perform searches by ID only.
- **Display and Navigation**: View your list of pending or already watched series and films, and easily navigate through management options. A local folder is created, containing image posters of movies and series you watched or want to watch.



## Code Structure

This project is structured into several modules:

- **database_manager**: Manages CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for the "To Watch" and "Watched" lists.
- **web_scraping**: Contains functions to extract up-to-date information online about series and films.
- **ui_manager**: Manages user input and error handling.
- **texts**: All text is organised into a single file with variables to streamline future translation efforts.



## Installation & Utilisation  

To run the project, first run this command on terminal to install the requirements:   

`pip install -r requirements.txt`   

Next, you need to download the version of ChromeDriver that is compatible with your machine. You can do so by visiting this link: [Download ChromeDriver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable).

Once downloaded, place the chromedriver file in the `utils` folder of your project. If you wish to modify the path to ChromeDriver, you can do so by changing the value of `ChromeDriver_path` in the `config.py` file.

launch the main script `main.py`, which opens the main menu to start managing your collection of series and films.
